# Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview:
I recently completed a project that aimed to predict customer churn using machine learning. The project involved training a model on a dataset of customers and their past behaviors, and then using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen customers.

## Objective:
The objective I set for myself was to build a model that accurately predicts customer churn, based on the customer's past behaviors and other relevant factors. I trained and tested the model on a dataset of customers, and evaluated the results to determine the accuracy of the model.

## Methodology:
Here's how I approached this project:

- Data Collection: I collected a dataset of customers and their past behaviors, including information on their usage, purchases, and other relevant factors.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: I trained a machine learning algorithm on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model using accuracy metrics, such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Model Deployment: I used the trained model to predict customer churn in new, unseen customers.

## Expected Results:
The expected results I achieved were an accurate model that can predict customer churn based on the customer's past behaviors and other relevant factors. I evaluated the model's accuracy and deployed it for making predictions.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I successfully completed a project that predicts customer churn using machine learning. The results of this project can be useful for businesses and marketers who are interested in retaining customers and reducing churn. The model I developed can help them identify at-risk customers and take action to retain them.
